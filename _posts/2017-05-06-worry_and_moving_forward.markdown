I’m coming to the end of my first month of coding here at Flatiron time for some reflection. I knew it wouldn't be easy, but I’m still worried that I’m not retaining the information as strongly as I would like. And I had a couple of life events that distracted me from coding for a couple of weeks. During those days away from coding, I was wondering if I should just stop and give up. Then the motivation for why I’ve started to code kicked in. I can do this! There are many out there that have more on their plates while trying to code. I just have to keep at it. I'm the only one holding myself back. 

The first couple of weeks of coding I was rushing through the lessons. I was more concerned with the fact that I need/should finish quickly, so I can save money. This thinking is definitely not the way to go about my coding. It is more important to really understand what I'm doing. This month my strategy is to stop, reflect, and really look at each step of coding before quickly moving onto the next lesson.

As with anything in life it is all about one step at a time. Life happens and I might have more delays in my learning, but I just have to keep going. Ask questions. I know my worries will always be around, but that just means I care about my learning. Moreover, the root of my worry is my future. I tend to over think, aka put my cart before the horse about my future.  I need to look at my future in the positive and I think some of my over worrying tendencies will slowly go away. 

And to end this first post I think a positive tweet is needed:
